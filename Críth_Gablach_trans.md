# This is a new translation of the edited text of **Críth Gablach** by D. A. Binchy (Dublin, 1946).  
### There is a translation of the text by Eoin Mac Neill in:  
### *MacNeill, Eoin. “Ancient Irish Law: The Law of Status or Franchise.” Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Section C: Archaeology, Celtic Studies, History, Linguistics, Literature 36 (1924 1921): 265–316.*  
### However, that translation is based on the **Ancient Laws of Ireland** and has been seriously outdated given the progress made in the study of early Irish law in the past century.  
### Therefore, a new translation is provided here on resulted from my own study and teaching. Most of the translation is based on the glossary given by Binchy at the back of his edition, but I have differed in many places as well. Generally speaking, my translation here is more literal so as to keep as closely as possible to the style and sometimes the syntax of the Old Irish sentences. I have also updated the rendering of several legal and farming terms. I have consulted eDIL, *A Guide to Early Irish Law*, *Early Irish Farming* and other recent publications in the process. 
### This is work in progress and is subject to constant revision.

1 **Cid ara·n-eperr Críth Gablach? Ní hansae: arindí crenas in fer túaithe dia dagfholtaib hi túaith co n-árimther ina grád téchtu i·mbí i túaith; nó ara lín di gablaib i·fodlaiter grád túaithe.**

Why is CG so called? Not difficult: because of that which the man of a túath purchases by his good considerations in a túath, so that he would be recognised in his proper grade in which he always is in a túath; or because of the [lit. their] number of the branches into which grades of a túath are divided.  
     
**cair: cis lir fodlai for suidib? a .vii.**  

Question: how many divisions on these? Seven.  
     
2 **Cid asa·fordailtea grád túaithe? A aurlunn grád n-ecalsa; ar nach grád bís i n-eclais, is coir cia beith a aurlann i túaith, dég ḟortaig nó díthig nó ḟíadnaisi nó brithemnachtae ó chách di alailiu.**  
     
On what basis have the grades of a túath been divided? In (lit. from) analogy to the grades of church; for every grade that is in the church, it is fitting that there be its analogy in the túath, because of superior oath or of denial by oath or of testimony or of adjudication by everyone to others.  
     
3 **Ceist: cateat grád túaithe? Fer midboth, bóaire, aire désa, aire ard, aire túise, aire forgill 7 rí.**  
     
   A question: what are the grades of a túath? Man of the middle huts, bóaire, Lord of vassalry, High-lord, Lord of precedence, Lord of overriding testimony and king.  
     
**Mad a dligiud fhénechais, is menbu sunn fo·ndáiliter na .vii. ngrád-so.**  
     
   If it be according to the law of fénechas these seven grades are divided more minutely here.  
     
**Cía menbae? Bóaire cona ocht fodlaib, aire désa, aire échta, aire ard, aire túise, aire forgaill, tánaise ríg 7 rí.**  
     
   What is the minuteness? B. with eight \[other] divisions, Lord of vassalry, Lord of slaughter, High-lord, Lord of precedence, Lord of overriding testimony, heir-apparent to a king and king.  
     
4 **Cateat fodlai bóairech? Dá fher midboth 7 ócaire 7 aithech ara·threba a deich 7 bóaire febsa 7 mruigfer 7 fer fothlai 7 aire coisring.**  
     
   What are the divisions of B.? Two \[types of] Man of the middle huts and Young-freeman and Vassal who farms by his tens and Bóaire of excellence and Man of withdrawal and Lord of binding obligation.  
     
5 **Cate imthach 7 naidm 7 ráth 7 fíadnaise 7 lóg n-enech 7 bíathad 7 othrus 7 snádud 7 taurchrecc 7 bés tige cach áe?**   
     
   What is the \[capacity of] compurgatory oath and binding-surety and paying-surety and testimony and honour-price and sustenance and sick-maintenance and protection and fief of base clientship and food-tribute of each one \[of these]?  
     
**Ní hanse: amail arind·chain fénechas: Ara·fesser gráda Féne, fri mes n-airechtae ad·rímter.**  
     
   Not difficult: as Fénechas recites it: ‘so that you should know the grades of Féni, by the judgment of assembled courts they are reckoned.’  
     
6 **Dá fer midboth, .i. fer midboth imma·thuing smachtu, im·toing ó snáthait co dairt. Is ed lóg a enech dia aír, dia díguin, dia esáin, dia ṡárugud.**       
   Two 'Man of Middle Huts', that is, F.M. who swears in compurgation of liabilities, he swears \[for the value] from a needle unto a yearling heifer. It is his honour-price for satire, violation of protection/breaching of household peace, refusal of hospitality and dishonouring against him.  
     
**Is ed saiges a naidm 7 a ráth 7 a fíadnaise 7 a aitire. A bíathad a óenur, ass 7 grus nó arbor; ní·dlig imb.**  
     
   It is what enforces (?) his binding-surety and his paying-surety and his testimony and his medial surety. His food-entitlement is for one man, milk and cheese or corn; he is not entitled to butter.  
     
**Snádid a chomgrád tara thúaith fadesin 7 bíatair leis co·ndichet tar crích.**  
     
   He protects his equal-grade across his own túath and he is fed by him until he has gone over the border.  
     
**Cid ara·n-eperr fer midboth dond fiur-so? Arindí do·ndichet a maicci, a dligiud altruma, 7 nád·roig fertaid;**  
     
   Why is the name 'Man of Middle Huts' given to this man? For the reason that he has come from boyhood, from the right of fosterage, and that he has not attained manhood. (cf. McLeod 1988)  
     
**In·forcmaither áes sainrethech dond ḟiur midboth imma·thoing smachtu? Forcmaither áes cetheora mblíadnae ndeec.**  
     
   Is a particular age set for the f.m. who swears in compurgation of liabilities? Let \[the] age of 14 be assigned.  
     
**Is airi ní·comrai insci ná fíadnaise, ar ní hinfíadnaisi acht fri cach súaill re secht mblíadnaib deec, nád·rogab seilb ná comarbus re sin, ma nis·comathar fer Féne lais. Iss é in sin imma·thoing smachtu mruigrechto.**  
     
   It is on account of it that he cannot preserve statement or eyewitness testimony, for he is not capable of giving valid witness except for every insignificant thing before seventeen years old, who has not acquired /cannot acquire landed property or inheritance before that, unless a fully capable member of the society (fer Féne) preserves it with him. It is that man who swears in compurgation of liabilities of land law.  
     
7 **In fer midboth aile con·oí insci is trebairiu-side. Tecmaltar a insce dó hi teora bríathra co dé treise; cota·oí cen tórmach cen dígbáil; immas·toing i ndeud nach aili arid·fét i llugu.**  
     
   The other f.m. who preserves statement, he is more substantial. His statement is assembled for him into three words until the third day; he preserves it without addition or diminution; \[and] he swears in compurgation to it after every other person who takes precedence over him in oath. (cf. McLeod 1988)  
**Ocus imm·toing colpdaig nó a lóg. Iss ed saiges a naidm, a ráth, a ḟiadnaise, a aitire. A bíathad a óenur, ass 7 grús nó arbur; ní·dlig imb. Snáidid a chomgrád tara thúaith co·tabarr díabul mbiid dó.**  
     
   And he swears a yearling heifer or its (equal) value in compurgation. It is what his binding-surety and his paying-surety and his testimony and his in-between surety enforces. His food-entitlement is for one man, milk and cheese or corn; he is not entitled to butter. He protects his equal-grade across his túath and double share of food is given to him.  
     
8 **Int othrus ní·fil indiu isind aimsir-so acht lóg a degḟoloig do chách íarna míad iter fochraicc lego 7 lind 7 bíathad, 7 lóg n-ainme, amairce, esboda, acht bid coitchenn dliges cach ngrád di grádaib túaithe i córus othrusa.**  
     
   The \[institution of] sick-maintenance, it is no longer extent today at this time, but \[replaced by] a price of his proper maintenance to each one, according to his status, \[including] the physician’s fee and drink and food, and a payment of lasting blemish, of visible defect, of loss of limb, but it is common that each grade from the grades of túath is entitled to it in stead of the proper arrangement of sick-maintenance \[i.e. dingbáil ‘removal’].  
     
**Tongair fri corp 7 anmain, 7 do·tét aitire ar ḟer feras in fuil i córus n-othrusa, i mboin. At·n-aig tar fót cruach i n-ardnemed dia díte, di·eim ar díantolae slúaig; i n-airgell tara ési cen lepaid ara·chuili liaig, i tárgud lego co derosc n-airṡláine ina íarsláini, i slán líno leptha, a snádud co forus túaithe.**  
     
   It is sworn by body and soul, and an in-between surety guarantees on behalf of the man who sheds the blood, for the proper arrangement of sick-maintenance, by means of a cow (value limited to a cow?). \[The culprit] coveys him over the bloody sod into a high sanctuary for his safeguard, which protects from a sudden tide of host; [the in-between surety guarantees] after that by a fore-pledge for not \[bringing him to] a bed that the physician forbids, for providing of physician until the verdict of the fore-health \[i.e. recovery to the previous state] in his subsequent health, for the safety of the ‘company of bed’, their protection \[until they get] to the appointed place \[of maintenance].  
     
**Cateat a ḟolta córai ó chách frisa·cuirther aitire? Frepuith réir lego. Ógḟritecht for rátha mani·éta nech a ḟrepaid ó ḟiur chinad, combi ar écin do·bongar; is co n-ógdíriu 7 eneclainn fo míad ad·gairther cid tre etged rop othar [1].**  
[1]: MS rotothar.  
   What are the proper duties [due] from everyone for whom an in-between surety is given? [To accept] the cure to the direction of a physician. Full amount of undertaking [is imposed] on the paying-sureties if anyone does not acquire his cure from the liable person, until it is by force that it is levied; it is with full amount of compensation and honour-price according to the rank that it is enforced, though it be through negligence that he was wounded (?).  
     
9 **Téit 7 a máthair for folog. Úachtar ar lemlacht dó i treisi, i cóicthi, i nómaid, i ndechmaid, i ndomnuch.**  
     
   He goes with his mother on maintenance. Cream besides new milk for him every third day, every fifth day, every ninth day, every tenth day, and every Sunday.  
     
**In·forcmaither \[áes sainrethech dond fiur midboth con·oí insci? Forcmaither áes] ó chetheoraib blíadnaib deec co fichtig co cúairtulchaigi.  
Cía beith ara·rogba bóairechas ríasíu ropo chúairtulchach, ní·íca a lugae acht a llugu ḟir midboth. Cía beith cen gabáil n-orbai danó co críni, ní·tét a lugae ó ḟiur midboth beos.**  
     
Is a particular age set for the f.m. who preserves statement? Let the age from 14 until the 20th year, until circuit-beardness, be assigned. Though he may be one who can acquire the status of a bóaire before he should be encircled by beard, his oath does not pay for (or 'exonerate'?)[2] \[the amount] except for by the oath of a fer midboth. Though he may be without taking inheritance until old age, however, his oath still does not go beyond [the level of] fer midboth.  
     
[2]: cf Ml. 55d11:  
   ícaid som didiu anisin anasmbeir iudicia domini· abisus multa  
   He solves that then when he says iudicia Domini abissus multa  
     
**Biith a thaurchrecc cóic sétaib. Molt cona ḟosair bés a thige, is é bés óenchineda in sin, fer nád·threba seilb ná ferann dó fadésin. Fosair in muilt: dí bairgin deec, imb n-eine óil, imglaice chainne co cennaib, ian óil ais trib asaib, óchtar 7 lemlacht 7 draumce nó bláthach.**  
     
   His ‘fore-purchase’ is five séts. A wether with its accessories is his food render, it is that which is the render of a single offspring, a man who does not farm property or land for himself (McLeod 1986, 67). Accessory food-rent of the wether: twelve loaves, butter of a vessel of a ‘drink’, a handful of wild garlic with bulbs, a vessel of a ‘drink’ of milk with three kinds of milk, cream and new milk and whey drink (? EIF 327-8) or buttermilk.  
     
**Ní·dligther fothud a thige do neoch céin mbes maice, co·mbí túalaing saintrebtha 7 gabálae selb, do ḟiur midboth céin mbes n-óenchiniud acht ma fris·nasar a ḟlaith nád·fuilne [nas. or len.?] a bés tar molt cona ḟosair.**   
     
   No hospitality of his house is due by anyone as long as he be in his childhood, until he is capable of independent husbandry and of taking landed properties; \[neither is it due] by a fer midboth as long as he be a solitary offspring, unless his lord be counter-bound not to increase his tribute beyond a wether with its accessory dues.  
     
   Ma for·bera folud a thige co·mbí folud mbóairech nó ní bes ardu, for·beir córus a thairchrecce dó-som a suidiu co·mbí bés a thige and íarna míad, mani·congla nach ḟlaith aile fris. Lethdrécht húad i ngort día treise íar fócru; trían a duinn 7 a mescae 7 a lescae 7 a ércae do ḟlaith.  
     
   If the consideration of his house increases so that it is [equal to] the consideration of a bóaire or anything that may be higher, the proper arrangement of his fore-purchase increases for him from there, until his food tribute therein is in accordance with his dignity, unless any other lord has joint grazing with him. Half the amount of labour [is due] from him in field on the third day after notice; a third of [the value of] his theft and his drunkenness and his idleness and his éraicc fine [is payable] to the lord.  
     
   10. Ócaire, is ardu a airechas-adi. Cid ara·n-eperr ócaire? Ar oítiu a airechsa cedacht, úaire is nue ó rogab trebad. Caiti a thothacht? Folod sechtae lais: .vii. mbaí cona tarb, .vii. muca co muic ḟorais, .vii. caírig; capall iter fognum 7 imrim.

Cethramthu arathair lais: dam, soc, brot, cennos, combí túalaing comsae. Cuit i n-áith, i mmuiliunn, i sabull, scaball cocúais.  
     
   The ócaire, his legal status is higher. Why is he called ócaire? On account that he is still young in his status, because it is new since he took up husbandry. What is his property? He has the consideration of these sevenfold things: seven cows with their bull, seven pigs with a ‘household-pig’, seven sheep; a horse [for] both service and riding. He has a tract of land worth seven cumal, that is a ‘land of cows’ in Irish law, which supports seven cows for the duration of a year, that is, seven cows are driven into it, [and] he leaves the seventh cow on the same day next year for the rent of the land. He has a quarter of a ploughing outfit: an ox, a ploughshare, a goad, a halter, until he is capable of joint husbandry. [He has] a share in a drying kiln, in a mill, in a granary, a pot of concavity(?).  
     
   Mét a thige: móu tig inchís, ar it .vii. traigid .x. a méit-side, fíthi co fordorus, eite iter cach dá ḟíthe ó ṡuidiu co cleithe; dá ndorus n-and, comlae ar ala n-aí, clíath ar alailiu; os hé cen chlíatha cen tulggu; udnocht coil imbi; clár ndara iter cach dí chóemdai. Is mó tech n-ócairech, noí traigid .x. a mét side; trí traigid .x. a airchae ara ro·randathar bés a thige indi.  
   The size of his house: it is bigger than a ‘house of ?’, for the latter’s size is 17 feet, wicker-work until the lintel, [and] feather between every two wicker-work from that to the ridge-pole. [There are] two doorways in it – one door in front of another, wattle before another. And [the house] is without hurdles and without bed-frames, palisade of thin sticks around it; board of oakwood between each two large beds. The house of an ócaire is larger, its size is 19 feet, its outhouse is 13 feet, so that his food-tribute can be divided in it.   
     
   Ocht mbaí a thaurchrecc, it é .x. séoit insin; is ed diabal taurchrecce in gráid fil riam. Ar is di thír gíallaid a ngrád n-í [sin?]; is di thír dano lóg a .x. sét dosom dia thauchreic; bíd dano a tír sin for fola fris dó.  
   Eight cows are his fore-purchase, that is 10 sét; it is double the fore-purchase of the grade that is before him. For it is by land that the grade serves its clientship (cf. Ml. 61c2: induine in chainchomraic hí); it is by land, moreover, that the value of 10 sét is [assigned] to him for his fore-purchase; the land, moreover, is on the consideration of the fief for him (?).  
     
   Dartaid inite cona thimthuch bés a thige; tarr muicce les is tinne íccas la boin, nó thinne ordlaig ina chumbu choir, 7 thrí méich mracha 7 leth méich tharai. Ar amail as ndiabul taurchrecce in gráid as ísliu tauchrecc in gráid as ardu, is diabul somoíne dano bés a thige.  
   A male calf in its first year of Shrovetide with its accessories is his food tribute; the belly of a pig of enclosures (?) and bacon are what he pays besides the cow, or bacon of a finger’s breadth in its proper cutting, and three sacks of malt and half a sack of kiln-dried wheat. For the fore-purchase of a higher grade is double of the fore-purchase of a lower grade, therefore, his food tribute is double the amount [of that of the grade below].  
     
   Snádid a chomgrád – ar ní·snáidi na grád nech bes ardu; bíathad deise dó di as 7 grus nó arbaimm, ní·dlig imb; cúad dá ordlach .x. di draumcu ar lemlacht cechtar n-aí 7 bairgen inruic nó dí bairgin banfuini.

   He protects his equal grade, for no grade protects anyone that may be higher [than himself]. Provision for two persons for him, [consisting] of milk and cheese or corn; he is not entitled to butter; a wooden mug of 12 fingers’ breadth of whey drink instead of (or mixed with?) fresh milk for each of the two [persons], and a big loaf of bread or two small loaves. He is one of two on sick-maintenance; butter in this case [is provided] on every third day, fifth day, ninth day, tenth day, on Sundays. His honour-price is three séts, but it is the séts in the form of cattle that are paid out to him.  
     
   11. Cid dia·n-éirenatar dósom int seoit so? Ní anse: dia aír, dia esáin, dia díguin, dia shárugud, di loscud a thige, dia thurorgain, di gait as – a leth di gait ind; di forcur a mná, a ingine. Acht is breth la Féniu: leth díri cach gráid túaithe for a mnaí 7 a mac 7 a ingen, acht mad dormuine nó mac bes élódach ria ngoiri, cethramthu for suidib.  
   Because of what are these séts paid out to him? Not difficult. Because of satirising him, illegal expelling him, violating his protection, dishonouring him, burning his house, robbing him, stealing from him – half the amount for bringing stolen property into his house, for raping his wife [or] his daughter. But [such] is the judgment in Irish law: half of the compensation of each grade of the túath [is given] upon his wife and his son and his daughter, but if it be a secondary wife or a son who would be escaping from the filial duties, a quarter upon these persons.  
     
   Lóg a enech, is ed imma·tuing 7 téit for a naidm 7 a ráith 7 a aitiri 7 a fíadnaise. Os in dá sét tesbanat airi húare nád n-óg fossugud a thige 7 nád n-inráith friu amal cách mbóairig ar lagait a folaid.  
   His honour price, it is [the same amount by] which he swears compurgatory oath, and it goes on his binding-surety and his paying-surety and his medial-surety and his witness. And the two séts that are lacking from it because the sustenance of his household is not complete and [because] he is not competent of taking up suretyship for [the amount of] them like each of the bóaire because of the smallness of his consideration.  
     
   12. Aithech ara·threba a deich  
   A vassal who farms with his tens, tenfold is his herd, that is, he has ten cows, ten pigs, ten sheep. He has a quarter of a ploughing outfit, namely, an ox and a plough-share and a goad and a halter etc.. He has a house of twenty feet, with an out-house of fourteen feet. Four séts are his compensation for satirising him, illegal expelling him, wounding him, dishonouring him. He swears compurgatory oath by that amount, and [his capacity of being a] binding-surety, and paying-surety, and medial-surety, and litigant, and witness [all] to the [same] amount. His fore-purchase is ten cows. The pick of the yearling beast (?) and bacon of two fingers in its proper cutting and four sacks of malt and a wooden vessel of an airmed of kiln-dried wheat, these are his food-tribute. [He has] proper equipment of both ironware and vessel.  
     
   This is the ‘baptismal vassal’ if he be in his propriety without stealth, without deceit, without wounding people except for on the day of battle or anyone who seeks to slay him. And he is with proper marital arrangement and chastity during fasting days and Sundays and Lent. What is it that separates this man from formal bóaire-status? Because of the custom that there is usually four or five men who are in heritance of a [deceased] bóaire so that [being] a bóaire is not easy for every one of them. Provision of two persons for him [consisting] of milk and cheese or corn, butter on Sundays, relish for condiment besides that – dullisk, wild garlic, salt. He is one of two on sick-maintenance, butter for him on every other day.  
     
   (cf. Ó Cróinín Peritia 3: 405 and Crigger 2000: 407)  
     
   13. Bóaire febsa  
   A ‘bóaire of excellence’, why is he so called? Because his freeman status and his honour-price [are founded] on [the basis of] cattle. He has landed property [worth] 14 cumals. [He has] a house of 27 feet with an outhouse of 15 feet, [he has] a share in the mill so that he grinds for his kindred and his party of guests, [he has] a drying kiln, a granary, a sheepfold, a pigsty. Those are the seven buildings by which every bóaire is compensated. He always has 12 cows, half of a ploughing outfit, a working horse and a horse for riding. His fore-purchase is 12 cows, a yearling bullock with its accessories is his food-tribute both [as] the summer food and the winter food. Five séts are for his compensation by anything which is an insult to him by reference to his honour-price.  
   What is it that gives the five séts to the honour-price of the bóaire? Not difficult, his deeds: a sét for his binding-surety, a sét for his paying-surety, a sét for his witness, a sét for his guarantor, a sét for his sustenance and his adjudication on land-law. He swears the compurgatory oath for five séts; they go on his binding-surety and his paying-surety and his guarantor and his witness. His food-provision is of three persons. He is one of three on sick-maintenance; butter for him on the second day, the third day, the fifth day, the ninth day, the tenth day, on Sundays. [He is entitled to] true garlic (?) or salted meat as relish. Anything that is lacking from the consideration of the bóaire is lacking from his compensation.  
   (translated in Crigger 2000: 410)  
     
   14. Mruigfer.  
   Mruigfer ‘landed man’, why is he so called? Because of the amount of landed property [he has]; that person has 21 cumal worth of land. He is the bóaire according to the judgment, the bóaire of propriety, so that every equipment in his house [is] in its proper state – a cauldron with its spit with its handle, a vat in which a measure of ale can be brewed, a cauldron of service, minor vessels [including] both ironware and kneading trough and wooden mugs so that he does not have to ask for them; a washing backet and a washing tub, a tub, a candlestick, knives for cutting rushes, rope, an adze, an auger, a saw, a pair of wooden shafts, an axe, working tools for every season – every type (?) of it [so that he needs] not ask – a grinding stone, a billhook, a hatchet, spears for killing livestock, fire that always burns, candle on the candlestick without failing, a full ploughing outfit with its complete accessories.  
     
   15. It é inso  
   These, then, are the behaviours of a bóaire according to the judgment. There are always two vessels in his house, a vessel of milk and a vessel of ale. [He is] a man of three snouts: snout of a boar under a ditch who cleaves dishonour every time, snout of a bacon on a hook, snout of a ploughing outfit under a tip (?), so that he is capable of taking in a king or a bishop or a sage or a judge from the road, for the arrival of every party of guests. [He is] a man [who has] always three sacks in his house in every season: a sack of malt, a sack of sea-ash for cutting up joints from his cattle, a sack of charcoal for ironwork. He has seven houses: a drying kiln, a granary, a mill – his share in the latter so that it grinds for him – a house of 27 feet, an outhouse of 17 feet, a pigsty, a pen for calves, a sheep pen. [He has] 20 cows, two bulls, six oxen, 20 pigs, 20 sheep, four boars of household, two sows, a horse for riding, a bridle of red enamel, 16 sacks in the ground. He has a bronze cauldron in which a boar can fit, he owns a pasture in which sheep can always be without removal. Fourfold of costumes for him and his wife. His wife is the daughter of an equal-grade man [and married as] a formal and chief spouse.   
     
   And he, good is his oath, his binding-surety, his paying-surety, his witness, his guarantor, his loan, his interests, without stealth without deceit without wounding people. His fore-purchase is two cumal, a cow with her accessories is his food-tribute for both winter food and summer food. [He has] a retinue of three men within the túath, and three men for him on sick-maintenance; he is always entitled to butter with condiment. He protects his equal grades. He is entitled to salted meat on the third day, the fifth day, the ninth day, the tenth day, and on Sundays. He swears compurgatory oath of six séts; his binding surety, paying-surety, witness, guarantor, suing party, [they are all worth] that amount.

   This is his full honour-price, but five séts are the price for transgressing his enclosure without asking for permission; forcing it [the enclosure?] open from outside is immune from liability (?). Five séts [are the price] for forcing open his house without permission, a milch cow for watching into it, a yearling bullock for [taking] a wisp from it, a yearling heifer for [taking] two, a two-year-old heifer for an armful [of it], a three-year-old dry heifer for half a bundle, a milch cow for a bundle plus the restitution of the house. Five séts [are the price] for going through his house or through his foreyard, by breaking his doors. A yearling bullock for [removing] a rod below, a two-year-old heifer for a rod above, a three-year-old dry heifer for a wattle below, a two-year-old heifer for a wattle above, a yearling heifer for the door post in front of the left of the house, a yearling bullock for the door post in front of the right of the house. Half of the honour price for each grade of the túath in case of theft [of property] that is not his [and bringing it] out of his enclosure, a seventh for theft [of property that is not his and bringing the item] into it. A throwing that is thrown [from] each side, that is the legal measure of his enclosure. Half the compensation for his household [is due] on the precincts.

   What is immune and what is liable to claim from the breaking on the floor of the house:  every excessively valuable thing is immune from claim, while every ordinary item is liable to claim; gold and silver and bronze are immune, while every bucket and every piece of furniture that is usually on the floor is liable; a yearling heifer for a post of couch at the back, a yearling bullock for a post of couch near the fire and at the front, with restitution of every one of them, regardless of whether it is excessively precious or ordinary; a yearling heifer of every piece of woodwork as far as the wall.  
   What is immune and what is liable to claim [when] breaking the couch: immune is the thing which is lower than the ordd, liable is the thing which is higher than the ordd; [the fine for] plundering his kitchen is the same as [that for] stripping his couch, or new es (straw?) for strewing it. The stripping of a compartment bed: if it be a wisp from the head of the pillow (?), it is paid with a good cushion; if it be a wisp from anything that is under the aforementioned part, it is paid with a good yearling calf; if it be a wisp from the legs, it is paid with good sandals, if it be a wisp from a wall, new rushes for strewing it; if it be a turning up side down, a sét into it and restitution.   
   What is immune and what is liable to claim for a compartment bed (?): immune is sitting and lying down into it, and [it is immune] even if someone damages it up to the same height of the head in it; liable is that [damage] which is higher than the head. The two forks are paid with a sét if it be in the guesting quarter (i.e. in the winter season), half [of that amount] after that.

   Grinding without permission in a mill of the ‘landed man’, [the fine] is five séts and forfeiture of the flour that is ground without permission, and his honour-price if it causes his retinue to fast. If it be a damage to it (the mill), honour-price of each person whose [mill] it is and restitution with fore-pledge of grinding. If it be his drying kiln that has been damaged without permission [of usage], a milch cow with a yearling heifer is the compensation and [on top of that] restitution. Immune is anything that is damaged inside it apart from adra (corn?) which is threshed on the ground and its own miscellany of objects (?). The compensation for his barn is five séts and [on top of that] restitution, together with [the compensation for] anything that has been damaged inside it. The compensation for his pigsty is five séts with [compensation for] the pigs and restitution. The compensation for his hatchet is a two-year-old heifer; half of it to his billhook before the time of hedging – a two-year-old heifer is [the price] for that.

   A ‘man of withdrawal’, why is he so called? That man precedes [the other types of] bóaire, because he withdraws from the commoner status by means of fore-purchase of clients. Excess are his cattle, his cows, his pigs, his sheep which his own land cannot support and which he cannot sell for land, he does not profit [from them], he gives [the excess] to fore-purchase of clients. What is the return of chattel of that man [from clientship]? Return of grain from them, price of by-product of cattle of every cow from [i.e. in the form of] grain of corn of food; for a vassal is not entitle to malt until he becomes a lord.

   A question: when does a vassal become a lord, [raised] from the status of a bóaire on account of the acquiring of pasture? When he has double the amount of what an aire désa has, and then he is an aire désa who is called a ‘bóaire who precedes bóaires’. He acquires pre-eminence over them if he grants fief to clients, [but] he is not an aire désa until he is doubly qualified, i.e. [he has] double [the income (?) sufficient to be] an aire désa. Eight séts is his honour-price if he has been a mruigfer before. When, therefore, he doubles the worth of a bóaire, it is then he becomes an aire désa, for the name of his grade does not change, although he has increased his honour-price to that [grade]. He swears the compurgatory oath for eight séts; [his] binding surety, paying-surety, medial surety, witness [and] capacity as a suing party, [each of these] is for that amount. His fore-purchase is worth four cumal, his food-tribute is a milch cow with her accessories every other year, and a male yearling calf with her in the other years. His house is 27 feet. The number of his retinue is four men, he is always entitled to butter with condiments. He has a band of four persons when going on sick-maintenance, entertainment of four; he has salted meat every third day, every fifth day, every ninth day, every tenth day, and on Sundays.

   Thus pronounces the native law on this grade: ‘the true lords are entitled to excess according to the rules [by which?] they calculate. A non-lord attains half the restitution of wealth which increases (?), unless it is ten séts which ennoble, five séts enforce contracts so that it is a rightful completeness of restitution, for half perishes by unlawful negligence.’  
     
   20. Aire coisring  
   Aire coisring ‘freeman of obligation’, why is he so called? Because it is he who the túath and the king and the synod bind by obligations on behalf of his kindred. He is not entitled to his compensation from them [the kindred] as regards oral contracts, unless they recognise him as leader and representative on their behalf. That person is the lord of the kin who provides pledge on behalf of the kin to a king and a synod and the professionals (áes cerdd) to constrain them accordingly. What is the amount of the pledge that he gives? A pledge of five séts in whatever form that he has, in silver or bronze or yew.  
   What is the compensation for his pledge? A milch cow for every night that it should spend on behalf of anyone, on behalf of whom it is handed over until the tenth night; interest of the pledge and compensation (indéraic) for his deed and his honour-price according to his rank after that [the milch cows] if it be the correct pledge that he has given. And if he has given a surplus of pledge, it is his honour-price and his whole pledge with its interest to be returned as such. A question: when does the pledge become forfeit? After a month. What is its compensation in such a case? A milch cow for every night that it should spend, should it be neglected on behalf of anyone without a pledge or submitting to judgement on the matter, as we have said; Five séts then, until the tenth day, and triple the amount, in this case; this is the compensation of his pledge. This is the interest of his chattel if he places it in a receptacle.  
   Nine séts is his honour-price, his binding surety, paying-surety, witness, suing party, in-between surety, [they are all worth] that amount. Five cumals is his fore-purchase, a milch cow with its accessories and a male yearling calf with its accessories in winter, with his summer-food, this is his food-tribute. A house of 30 feet with an outhouse of 19 feet. His retinue has five persons, he is entitled to butter with relish of condiments; he is entitled to have salted meat on the third day, on the fifth day, on the ninth day, on the tenth day, and on Sundays.

   The honour-price of each great from now on is complete unless their considerations fail, i.e. that they did not fall into the seven things in which the honour of each is diminished [lit.: the face of each falls]. What are these [seven things]? Not difficult: 1) satirising him for an offence without pledge [put in place] for his honour, 2) false-judgment, 3) perjury, 4) non-fulfilment of [his duty as] a binding surety, 5) absconding from [his duty of] paying-surety, 6) violating his in-between surety for something that he has pledged surety for, 7) defilement on his face. A question: what is it that washes these seven things off from the faces of each? Not difficult: every dirt that defiles the face of a person, there are three [things] for washing them off,  i.e. pumice stone and water and towel. This is the pumice stone, firstly, the confession of misdeeds in the presence of people and a pledge that he shall not turn to them again; the water, then, [is] to pay for anyone that perishes via his misdeeds; the towel, [that is] penance of the misdeeds according to the books.

   The arrangement of lords, i.e. lord from \[rec. of?] vassalage  to a king. How many divisions [are there] upon them? Seven. What are they? Lord of vassalage, Lord of slaughter, High-lord, Lord of precedence, Lord of overriding testimony, heir-apparent to a king and king. What is it that ennobles them? Their vassalage  [and] their entitlement of each of them, however small or large. A query: what is the vassalage of a lord, according to the rule of recognition of craft/office?  There are four vassalage for lords: 1) old recognition of a kingdom; 2) his office in a kingdom, concerning office of a leader or that of an heir-apparent, whichever office is of those; 3) his clients of base-clientship; 4) his free-clients; 5) his serfs.  Double-edged is each base-clientship of uncertainty, it brings to the land an adherence to servile tenure and to the tenancy at will, for their benefits are greater than remission.  If there be service from them for lords until the ninth [man] away , they are bothachs and fuidirs; they become serfs thereafter.  
     
   24. Aire désa  
   Aire désa ‘Lord of vassalage’, why is he so called? For the fact that he is to be compensated on account of his vassalage. This is not the same for a bóaire: that person is to be compensated on account of his livestock. What are the properties of an aire désa? He has ten clients – five clients of base clientship and five free clients. His five base clients, they are obliged to provide the fixed food provision: a cow with her accessories and a yearling male calf and three male calves in their first year for each winter, with his summer food for him from the five clients of base clientship. Ten couples are his proper arrangement for coshering from New Year’s Day to Shrove Tuesday. And he is the son of a lord and the grandson of a lord with properties of his house including strewn floor and entertainment and propriety (?). [He has] a house of 27 feet with a proper outhouse; eight sleeping compartments with their furniture inside; goblets, cauldrons with his full [set of] vessels of a lord’s house around a vat. He defends the entitlement of his clients concerning liabilities [arising from] contract, promulgated law (cáin), treaty with anything that follows them (?).  A bed for [his] fosterling, for [his] foster-brother, for a man, for a woman, for a son, for a girl.  He upholds them on the basis of law-abidingness, according to the proper arrangement of kindred, of túath, of lordship, of the Church, of the promulgated law, and of treaty. 6 cumals is his fore-purchase from a lord, two milch cow with their accessories is his food-tribute in the winter, together with his summer-food. [Apart from] a suitable riding horse with silver rein, he has four [other] horse with fetters and reins, and a precious brooch worth an ounce. [He has] a lawful, fitting chief partner from the same cenél with the same amount of clothing. His honour-price is 10 séts, he swears compurgatory oath of that amount, his binding surety, paying-surety, in-between surety, suing party, witness, [they are all] to that amount. Six persons are his retinue in the túath, he is always entitled to butter with salted condiments, that is a lord ‘of a pig’s side’ (flaith mucleithe). He has six persons on sick-maintenance, sustenance of six persons; butter and salted meat for him on the second day, on the third day, on the fifth day, on the ninth day, on the tenth day, and on Sundays.  
   What is it that gives the 10 séts to the honour-price of that man? Firstly, 5 séts of his own house, and 5 from the five houses that are in clientship to him,  without anything that would secretly take away his lordship from the small and big considerations (?) so that he may not be degraded from his authority.   
     
   25. Aire échta  
   Aire échta ‘Lord of slaughter’, why is he so called? Because he is the leader of a ‘group of five’ [i.e. of a kin-group] which is excluded from committing slaughter under a treaty until the end of a month, to avenge the dishonouring of a kingdom from which a person has recently been slain. Provided they do not do so before the end of the month, they go [to wreak vengeance] on the treaty-kingdom and their protection does not lie with him there. If the same five should kill a person covered by the treaty, the a. é. pays on their behalf. Neither land not copper objects go for it [but] vessels of a cow’s value. However, he brings them out [with him] on their way to the border of the treaty-kingdom as the [lawful] number of his protection and his retinue [i.e. while they are within his own kingdom]. (trans. McLeod 2013, 110)  
     
   26. Aire ardd  
   Aire ard ‘High-lord’, why is he so-called? Because he is higher than the ‘Lord of vassalage’ and it is he who precedes him. He has twenty clients, ten base clients and ten free clients. His base clients, two cows with their accompaniment to him from each of them and three two-year-old bullocks and five yearling bullocks from each for winter-food and summer-food. He represents his clients for contract and treaty; each grade that is lower than he can be in clientship to him. Fifteen séts the value of his face; he swears to that amount. He is enforcing surety and paying surety and hostage surety and suing party and witness for that amount. What gives fifteen séts as honour-price to this man? Five séts to him first for the property of his own house, a sét for each client who owes him fixed renders. Seven persons are his retinue in the túath, five for private business; butter with condiment for them always. He has seven persons on sick-maintenance; hospitality for seven; salt meat and butter to him with condiment on the first, third, fifth, ninth, and tenth day and on Sunday. Seven cumals his client-price; three cows with their accompaniment his house-custom. Twenty couples his lawful retinue for ‘coshering’ between New Year’s day and Shrove Tuesday.  
   (translation Crigger 2000: 411-2)  
     
   27. Aire túise  
   Aire túise ‘Lord of precedence’, why is he so called? Because he is the leader of his kindred (cenél) and he precedes the ‘High-lord’. He has 27 clients, [including] 15 clients of base-clientship, and 12 free-clients. His clients of base-clientship, four milch cows with their accessories for him from them, and five two-year-old bullock and six yearling bullocks for every winter with his summer-food. 8 cumals is his fore-purchase from a king, four milch cows with their accessories is his food-rent. Eight persons are his retinue in his túath, another six on the side; he is always entitled to butter with condiments. [He has] eight persons on sick-maintenance, sustenance for eight persons; butter for him with condiments and ale or milk in its place on the second day, on the third day, on the fifth day, on the tenth day, on Sundays. His honour-price is 20 séts, he swears compurgatory oath [of that amount], his binding surety, paying-surety, in-between surety, suing party, witness, [they are all] to that amount. He is able to pay that amount if  he claims without requisition or a loan. 30 couples are his proper arrangement for ‘coshering’ from New Year’s Day until Shrove Tuesday. 29 feet is his house, and 19 feet is his outhouse; 8 compartments in the house with their full set of furniture [that befits] the house of a ‘Lord of precedence’, including 6 sets of bedding with their proper arrangement of accessories including cushions and hides for sitting. The house is properly strewn, yew-wood items of every size and ironware for every type of work and bronze vessels including cauldron in which there is room for a cow with bacon.

   30. Rí, cid ara n-eperr?  
   A king, why is he so called? Because he extends (riges) by means of coercive power over his túath. A question: how many divisions [are there] over the kings? Three divisions. What are they? King of peaks, king of hosts, the ultimate king over each individual.  
     
   31.Rí benn cétamus  
   ‘King of peaks’, firstly, why is he so called? That is the king of a túath, who has seven grades of Féni with their sub-divisions in clientship, for they are the peaks of lordship that we have enumerated. His honour-price is 7 cumals, one cumal for each primary grade that is under his power; he swears compurgatory oaths for the same amount, and binding-surety, and paying-surety, and medial-surety, and litigant, and witness [all] to the [same] amount. He pays these without a requisition, without a loan, although he may so demand. His retinue in his túath [consists of] 12 men, with another nine besides. A company of ten men on sick-maintenance [and] for the arrangement of his food provision. His fore-purchase is 12 cumals, his food-tribute is 6 cows.  
     
   32. Rí buiden  
   ‘King of hosts’, why is he so called? For he is a leader of two troops or three troops, each troop of 700 men. He is the king of three or four túaths. His honour-price is 8 cumals, because he carries of many hostages, two or three or four, as it is sung:  
     
   His retinue in his túath [consists of] 20 men, with another 12 besides. A company of ten men on sick-maintenance [and] for the arrangement of his food provision. His fore-purchase is 15 cumals, his food-tribute is 8 cows. A ‘king of hosts’ is excluded from sick-maintenance; 8 cumals are [the price] which replaces his sick-maintenance. His honour-price is 8 cumals; he swears compurgatory oaths for the same amount, and binding-surety, and paying-surety, and medial-surety, and litigant, and witness [all] to the [same] amount. He pays these without a requisition, without a loan, although he may so demand.  
     
   33. Rí bunaid cech cinn danó…  
   The ‘ultimate king over each individual’, then, why is he so called? Because it is under the power of his coercion that everyone is, who his lord does not constrain, because every person that is stronger helps the one that is weaker. That man is the king of overkings. His honour-price is 14 cumals; because kings and túaths are under his power and by his control (?); he swears compurgatory oaths for 14 cumals, and binding-surety, and paying-surety, and medial-surety, and litigant, and witness [all] to the [same] amount. His retinue in his túath [consists of] 30 men, with another 17 besides. A company of ten men on sick-maintenance [and] for the arrangement of his food provision. Every one of these is incoercible.   
   Among the grades in a túath, a king of overkings, a chief-sage, and a hospitaller [are] excluded from sick-maintenance. Half the sick-maintenance of each grade is due to his lawful son and his wife. because every legitimate [is worth] half, and every illegitimate [is worth] a quarter. A hired woman , her sick-maintenance [is measured] against the honours of his son or husband; stewards and messengers, they are entitled to sick-maintenance to half the amount of their lord…  
     
   34. It é fodlai flatha do-ruirmisem imma-berat fuillechtai flaithemnasa a somoínib sét.  
   These are the types of lords that we have enumerated, which bring into play the divisions of lordship by the profit of chattels.  
     
     
   35. Cair: cía de as sruithiu, in rí fa thúath?  
   A question: which one is nobler, the king or his túath? The king is of higher status, although they are of equal status, for it is the people who ordain the king, it is not a king who ordains people (Charles-Edwards 1994: 108)  
   What are the contractual obligations of a king to a people who ordains him? Oath on their behalf against [another] king at the boundary of the territory: he swears in denial from them [i.e. his oath clears them], he swears over them [for] 7 cumals, he goes into joint judgment and into joint testimony against [another] king on behalf of his túath. They are entitled that he give (?) judges of truth to them, they are entitled to pledge [from the king] on their behalf. They are entitled to sick-maintenance as he is maintained. They are entitled that he does not pledge a gathering upon them which the whole túath does not proclaim but rather only the neighbours.  
     
   36.Teora tomalta ata chórai do ríg for a thúaith:  
   Three consumptions that are fit for the king upon his túath: a gathering and a meeting for coercion and a rally to the boundary. It is up to the túath, however, to adjust (?) the gathering, [whereas] it is up to the king what he pledges upon the gathering, unless what he pledges is not proper. A question: how many [things] are proper for a king to pledge upon his túath? Three. What are they? A pledge for hosting, a pledge for promulgating law, a pledge for treaty, for those are beneficial to the whole túath.  
     
   37. Cis lir slógaid ata chórai do ríg do giull for a thúatha?  
   How many hosting are proper for a king to pledge upon his túath? Three. What are they? Hosting inside the boundary in the middle for defending against a host across it [the boundary], hosting unto the edge of the boundary for guarding truth and right so that he might have war or treaty, hosting across the boundary against another túath that absconds from him.  
     
   38. Ataat danó cetheoir rechtgi…  
   Moreover, there are four [types of] promulgated law that a king pledges [for them] upon his túath. What are they? Promulgation of native law at first – it is the túaths that approve it, it is the king who consolidates it; the three other types of promulgated law, it is the king who enforces it: promulgated law after they have been defeated in battle so that he can consolidate his túaths afterwards, lest they destroy each other; promulgated law after a plague; and promulgated law of a king like the promulgated law of the king of Cashel for Munster. For there are three [types of] promulgated law that are proper for a king to pledge upon his túaths: a promulgated law for destroying foreign race, i.e. the Saxons, and promulgated law for the manuring of crop, and promulgated law of the belief that ignites, like the law of Adomnán.  
     
   39. It é folad fírflaithemon inso…  
   These are the obligations of ‘truth of lordship’ upon his túaths and he does not violate them by means of falsehood or coercion or violence; he should be soundly mediating and impartial between the weak and the strong. There are, moreover, three other things that they demand from a king: [that] he be a man of full righteousness on every side, he be a man of enquiring of knowledge [from the learned], he be a residence of patience.  
     
   40. Ataat cethair tóraic do-berat díre n-aithig do ríg  
   There are four discoveries which give the honour-price of a vassal to a king. What are they? Discovery of him at three ‘handles of vassal’ – handle of a maul, handle of an axe, handle of a spade – for as long as he is at them, he is a vassal. Discovery of him alone by himself, for it is not proper for a king to go about by himself: that is the occasion [when] a lone woman over-swears her son upon a king, the occasion which no one gives his testimony. There is only one month [in which] the king travels around with only four persons. Who are these four? The king and the judge and two to serve them. Which month [is it] in which he travels in that manner? The month of sowing. Wounding him at the back of his head whilst fleeing from the battlefield, moreover, gives the honour-price of a vassal to him, except if it be through them [the enemies] that he goes – for it is as such that the two napes of a king are compensated by [the price of] his [full] honour.
